- Move resposibility of scraping out of the lunchdata package.
- Make the lunchdata package as simple as possible. Make it usable as a plain data container, and don't have lots of magic methods on it.

	* Slices will become slow when doing lookups if the higher level collections start to grow.

- [ ] Rename server/Dockerfile to server/Dockerfile.remote or something.
- [ ] Create new Dockerfile that works well with Docker hub, and locally,

- [ ] Restructure the repo. Maybe move server/* up to top level.
- [ ] Find a better solution than staticlunchlist.go
- [x] Pass in GTag from cli or something, don't store in code
- [x] Do some linting and clean up code
